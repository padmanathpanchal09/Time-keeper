WHY U NEED THIS:
This is a Background Time Keeper Extension that shows you how much time is left in the year. It serves as a reminder for you to accomplish the goals you promised yourself at the beginning of the yearâ€”whether it's joining a gym, following a healthy diet plan, planning trips with friends, or applying for jobs, just like I am.
Time is limited, and we often make many promises to ourselves on New Year's Day that we haven't fulfilled yet. So, JUST DO IT NOW! This extension will remind you every time you open a new tab. Feel free to let me know if you need any more adjustments!
